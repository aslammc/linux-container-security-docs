### Kernel Space vs User Space

>Kernel space is strictly reserved for running a privileged operating system kernel, kernel extensions, and most device drivers. In contrast, user space is the memory area where application software and some drivers execute.

No user process can access the Kernel Space. Additionally User space is also sandboxed for each process. Shared memory can be facilitated.
