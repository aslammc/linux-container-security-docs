### What is the Linux Kernel?

>The Kernel is responsible for directing the hardware and software. It is held entirely in the RAM by Reserving the Kernel Space. It also manages the system memory resources as best as possible. It directs the operations using the drivers installed in the Kernel or installed afterward in the form of kernel modules.

### How Did The Linux Kernel Start?

>It was created by a Finnish student by the name of Linus Torvalds in 1991. He sent out an email to a mailing list saying, “Hello everybody out there using minix — I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and professional like gnu) for 386 (486) AT clones.”

### Functions of the Kernel:
- Manages the hardware
- Instructs the CPU
- Bridges hardware and running processes
- Process and Memory management
- Device Drivers
- System Calls and more.
